                        <p>FoodFinderGA shares your concerns about privacy on the Internet. In order to better protect
                            your privacy, FoodFinderGA has provided this notice explaining its online information
                            practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used
                            on the Site. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy, being part of the Terms, works in conjunction
                            with the Terms and Conditions of Use, but does not modify or supersede it. On occasion,
                            FoodFinderGA may post additional privacy terms in conjunction with activities that modify
                            and/or supplement this Privacy Policy and govern the use of information related to or
                            received through such activities.</p>

                        <h3>FoodFinderGA's Collection and Use of Your Information</h3>

                        <p>In the course of using the Site, FoodFinderGA may collect certain non-personally identifiable
                            information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using
                            (e.g. Internet Explorer or Firefox, Safari, or Chrome), the type of operating system you are
                            using, (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider
                            (e.g., AT&T or Verizon or Comcast), aggregate data about the number of visits to the Site
                            and/or aggregate data about the pages visited.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How FoodFinder Uses the Information</h3>

                        <p>FoodFinderGA uses the non-personally identifiable information ("Aggregate Data") to improve
                            the design and content of the Site and to enable FoodFinderGA to personalize your Internet
                            experience. FoodFinderGA may use the Aggregate Data to analyze Site usage as well as create
                            services and/or products to fit your needs. FoodFinderGA shall own such Aggregate Data and
                            maintain copies of such as part of its records.</p>

                        <p>Except as otherwise indicated, FoodFinderGA uses the Aggregated Data you provide about
                            yourself: (a) to cooperate with government officials or parties in litigation under process
                            of law, or as otherwise required by law; (b) to protect the security or integrity of the
                            Site; (c) to protect against a threat of safety or destruction of property; and/or (d) to
                            protect against legal liability. In all cases, however, FoodFinderGA agents, employees and
                            contractors who have access to this Aggregated Data are required to protect this information
                            in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. However, FoodFinderGA shall own all
                            such Aggregate Data and maintain copies of such as part of its records. The Aggregate Data
                            may be transferred, distributed or sold as part of FoodFinderGA or its assets.</p>

                        <h3>Security; No Liability </h3>

                        <p>FoodFinderGA has implemented security measures to help protect against the risk of loss,
                            misuse and alteration of any information under FoodFinderGA's control. FoodFinderGA protects
                            your online information by using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology. SSL encrypts your
                            information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than FoodFinderGA.
                            Nevertheless, such security measures may not prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of
                            information on the Site, and FoodFinderGA is not responsible for any damages or liabilities
                            relating to any such security failures. You understand that data and communications,
                            including e-mail and other electronic communications, may be accessed by unauthorized third
                            parties when communicated over the Internet. Furthermore, the Site contains links to other
                            web sites. FoodFinderGA is not responsible for nor can FoodFinderGA ensure the privacy
                            practices or content of such other sites.</p>

                        <h3>IP Addresses and Cookies </h3>

                        <p>Like other web sites, FoodFinderGA uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with
                            FoodFinderGA's servers, to administer the Site and for security purposes.<br/>
                            "Cookies" are pieces of data sent from a Web server to a Web browser that enable a Web
                            server to identify users that visit a site hosted by that server. FoodFinderGA may use
                            Cookies in order to identify you to our site so that FoodFinderGA can provide more
                            customized information and services to you. In addition, our site may contain advertisements
                            that may contain Cookies. In general, if you choose, you can disable the use of Cookies by
                            reviewing your browser's preferences and options.</p>

                        <h3>A Special Note about Children </h3>

                        <p>FoodFinderGA does not knowingly gather any personally identifiable information from children
                            under the age of 13. You must be 13 years of age or older to access the Site. FoodFinderGA
                            has no interest in collecting information from children under the age of 13.</p>

                        <h3>Modification of Privacy Policy </h3>

                        <p>FoodFinderGA may change this Privacy Policy at any time, consistent with the terms set forth
                            in the Terms and Conditions of Use, by posting the changed or amended Privacy Policy on the
                            Site. Your continued viewing of or use of this Site following the posting of any changes to
