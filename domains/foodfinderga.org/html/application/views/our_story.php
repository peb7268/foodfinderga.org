				<h4>ABOUT US</h4>
				<p class="author">By Jack Griffin, Founder – FoodFinderGA</p>

				<p>In early 2013, Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes interviewed a 12 year-old girl and 
				her 10 year-old brother. Medical bills for their late mother cost the family 
				everything, including bankruptcy and losing their home. The two kids and their 
				father lived in their truck, not knowing where their next meal might come from. I 
				was 15 years old at the time. This segment made me think about what I was worried 
				about when I was 10 or 12, and finding food definitely wasn’t on my mind.</p>

				<p>Before the 60 Minutes segment, I didn’t have an idea of what children living in 
				poverty even looked like. In January 2014, the homeless services coordinator for the 
				Gwinnett County Public Schools informed me, “There are children living in spaces 
				meant for boxes and furniture. After being exploited out of what little money they 
				have by cheap, unsafe hotels, storage units are the last resort for poor families if 
				they want a roof over their head.”</p>

				<p>Her words stirred a sea of emotions in me: anger, frustration, disbelief, and 
				sadness all mixed in a strange blend that made me cringe. How could such horrific 
				conditions exist in a county that seems so well-off?</p>

				<p>After watching this piece, I decided to help kids like that in my community. I 
				wanted to join in the fight against child hunger and food insecurity in Georgia, but I 
				sought to do something more than just volunteering a few times at a food bank – I 
				wanted to do something that would serve many kids, and that would last.</p>

				<p>Through the surprisingly arduous task of trying to find free food resources in 
				Gwinnett County – home to 10% of all the public school kids in Georgia - I had the 
				idea to create a geo-located app that would automatically locate both the user and 
				the closest free food resources near them, such as food banks, soup kitchens, and co-
				ops. A tool that can tell those kids where to receive food for no cost based only their 
				current location, or their school’s name, or any address they entered.</p>

				<p>The website development work began in January 2014 under the direction of 
				Dennis Nelson, our Project Manager. To pay for the coding, I used crowd funding 
				with an Indiegogo.com campaign. I raised $5,970 from 78 contributors in 2 
				countries in one month.</p>

				<p>www.foodfinderga.org went live on May 6, 2014, and has been visited by 
				thousands of people in Gwinnett County and beyond. The site provides total privacy 
				to the user and it’s use is growing among Gwinnett County Public School teachers, 
				counselors, and students. In May 2015, the site expanded to serve the entire state of 
				Georgia – over 1.7 million kids in over 2,300 public schools through over 1,700 
				resource providers.</p>

				<p>My goal remains the same: to make food insecure kids’ meal times just a little 
				less grueling, by letting them know there is free food, close by, right now, so that 
				they don’t have to worry about their next meal every day.</p>
